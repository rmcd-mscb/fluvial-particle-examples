## Choose Your Path

### Working with this Repository

If you're exploring the examples in this repository:

1. [Running Notebooks Interactively](interactive-notebooks.qmd) - Set up VS Code to run `.qmd` notebooks with the pixi environment

### Using in Your Own Projects

If you want to use `fluvial-particle` in your own notebooks and projects:

2. [Setting Up Your Own Environment](user-environment.qmd) - Create a standalone conda environment

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Install pixi environment | `pixi install` |
| Register Jupyter kernel (pixi) | `pixi run register-kernel` |
| Create conda environment | `conda env create -f environment.yml` |
| Register Jupyter kernel (conda) | `python -m ipykernel install --user --name fluvial-particle --display-name "Fluvial Particle"` |
| List kernels | `jupyter kernelspec list` |

## Understanding Jupyter Kernels

A common point of confusion: **Python environments and Jupyter kernels are separate systems**.

- **Python environment**: A folder with Python + packages (conda env, venv, pixi)
- **Jupyter kernel**: A registered "connection" that notebooks use to run code

VS Code auto-discovers conda/venv environments but **pixi environments must be manually registered** as Jupyter kernels. This is why we provide the `pixi run register-kernel` command.

See [Running Notebooks Interactively](interactive-notebooks.qmd) for details.
