## Welcome

This repository contains example datasets, tutorials, and visualizations for the [fluvial-particle](https://github.com/rmcd-mscb/fluvial-particle) Python package.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/rmcd-mscb/fluvial-particle-examples.git
cd fluvial-particle-examples

# Install dependencies with pixi
pixi install

# Run an example simulation
pixi run simulate --settings examples/basic/options_straight.py --output outputs/straight
```

## Getting Started

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Running Notebooks Interactively](getting-started/interactive-notebooks.qmd) | Set up VS Code to run examples with pixi |
| [Setting Up Your Own Environment](getting-started/user-environment.qmd) | Create a conda environment for your projects |

## What is Fluvial Particle?

Fluvial-particle is a Lagrangian particle tracking model for simulating the transport of particles (sediment, larvae, debris) in river flows. It uses pre-computed velocity fields from hydrodynamic models and tracks individual particles as they move through the flow.

### Key Features

- **2D and 3D tracking**: Track particles in depth-averaged or fully 3D velocity fields
- **Multiple particle types**: Passive tracers, falling particles, larval behavior models
- **Time-varying flows**: Support for unsteady flow conditions
- **VTK integration**: Read VTS/VTK grids from CFD models
- **Parallel computing**: MPI support for large-scale simulations

## Examples

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Quickstart](examples/basic/quickstart.qmd) | Run your first simulation |
| [Straight Channel](examples/basic/straight_channel.qmd) | Simple 2D tracking in a straight channel |
| [3D Vertical Mixing](examples/3d_tracking/vertical_mixing.qmd) | 3D particle tracking with vertical dispersion |
| [Unsteady Flow](examples/time_varying/unsteady_flow.qmd) | Time-varying velocity fields |

## Datasets

Example datasets are stored using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for efficient handling of large files.

| Dataset | Description | Size |
|---------|-------------|------|
| `data/grids/straight_channel/` | Simple straight channel (2D + 3D) | ~5 MB |
| `data/grids/time_series/` | Time-varying flow (5 timesteps) | ~20 MB |

## Installation

This project uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh) for dependency management:

```bash
# Install pixi (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Install all dependencies
pixi install

# Start JupyterLab for interactive exploration
pixi run lab
```
